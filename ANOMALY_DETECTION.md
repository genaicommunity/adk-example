- ✅ **Decision Tree**: Clear logic for choosing between SQL-based vs ML-based anomaly detection
- ✅ **Concrete Examples**: 4 detailed examples showing forecast(), ask_data_insights(), and combined approaches

**Implementation**:
- Tools available in `bigquery_full_toolset` (bigquery_tools.py:74-86)
- Prompt guidance in `prompts.py` (lines 219-348)
- SQL Generation Agent automatically selects the right approach based on query keywords

These features complement the existing SQL-based analytics to provide **enterprise-grade anomaly detection**.

## 📊 Two Levels of Anomaly Detection

### Level 1: SQL-Based Anomaly Detection (Already Working)

The agent can detect anomalies using standard SQL analytics:

**Example Queries**:
```
"Find applications where February 2025 costs are 50% higher than January 2025"

"Show me services where costs spiked in the last 7 days"

"Which applications have the highest cost variance over the past 3 months?"

"Identify any unusual spending patterns in February 2025"
```

**How It Works**:
1. Agent analyzes your question
2. Generates SQL with window functions, aggregations, and comparisons
3. Executes query on BigQuery
4. Returns anomalies with context

**Best For**:
- Simple threshold-based alerts
- Comparing periods (month-over-month, week-over-week)
- Identifying top outliers
- Quick anomaly checks

---

### Level 2: ML-Based Anomaly Detection ✅ FULLY INTEGRATED

The agent now uses **BigQuery AI** for advanced anomaly detection:

#### A. Time Series Forecasting with `forecast()`

Predicts future costs and detects deviations from expected patterns.

**Example Queries**:
```
"Forecast cost trends for the next 30 days and identify any applications deviating from the forecast"

"Use ML to predict expected costs for March 2025 and compare against actual spending"

"Which applications are likely to exceed budget based on ML forecasts?"

"Show me cost forecasting with confidence intervals"
```

**How It Works**:
1. Agent calls BigQuery's `ML.FORECAST()` function
2. Uses ARIMA time series models trained on your historical data
3. Returns predictions with confidence intervals
4. Highlights deviations from forecast

**Best For**:
- Trend analysis and forecasting
- Detecting unusual patterns (seasonality, trends)
- Predictive budget alerts
- Capacity planning

---

#### B. Natural Language Insights with `ask_data_insights()`

Gets AI-generated insights about your cost data using natural language.

**Example Queries**:
```
"What insights can BigQuery AI provide about cost anomalies in February 2025?"

"Ask BigQuery AI: Are there any unusual spending patterns in my cost data?"

"Use ML to analyze cost trends and highlight anomalies"

"What does BigQuery AI say about our cloud spending efficiency?"
```

**How It Works**:
1. Agent calls BigQuery's `ask_data_insights()` function
2. BigQuery AI analyzes your data using Gemini models
3. Returns natural language insights about patterns, outliers, correlations
4. Agent synthesizes insights into final report

**Best For**:
- Exploratory data analysis
- Finding hidden patterns
- Correlations between dimensions (cloud, application, service)
- Executive summaries

---

## 🧪 Test Queries for Anomaly Detection

### Quick Tests (Use in ADK Web UI)

**1. Basic SQL Anomaly Detection**:
```
"Find applications with costs above $10,000 in February 2025"
```
→ Uses: SQL aggregation (Level 1)

**2. ML Forecasting**:
```
"Forecast total costs for the next 14 days"
```
→ Uses: BigQuery `ML.FORECAST()` (Level 2A)

**3. Natural Language Insights**:
```
"What insights can you provide about cost anomalies?"
```
→ Uses: BigQuery `ask_data_insights()` (Level 2B)

**4. Combined Approach**:
```
"Use ML to forecast costs for next month, compare with budget, and identify anomalies"
```
→ Uses: Multi-table JOINs + ML forecasting + comparison logic

## 📊 Performance Tips

### For Best ML Forecasting Results

1. **Data Volume**:
   - Minimum: 30 days of historical data
   - Recommended: 90+ days for accurate trends
   - Ideal: 1+ year for seasonality detection

2. **Data Granularity**:
   - Daily aggregations work best for short-term forecasts (7-30 days)
   - Weekly aggregations for medium-term (1-3 months)
   - Monthly aggregations for long-term (3-12 months)

3. **Table Partitioning**:
   - Partition cost tables by `date` column
   - Reduces query costs for ML forecasting
   - Improves performance on large datasets

4. **Query Optimization**:
   - Be specific about time ranges ("next 14 days" vs "future costs")
   - Specify applications/services for focused forecasts
   - Use confidence intervals for uncertainty quantification

---

## 🔒 Security & Compliance

### Data Privacy

- **Read-Only**: All operations are read-only (`WriteMode.BLOCKED`)
- **No Data Modification**: Agent cannot INSERT, UPDATE, or DELETE data
- **Audit Logging**: All BigQuery queries are logged in Cloud Audit Logs

### Cost Control

- **Query Cost Estimation**: BigQuery AI functions may have additional costs
- **Forecast Limits**: Recommend limiting forecast horizon to 90 days
- **Quota Management**: Monitor BigQuery job quotas

### Best Practices

1. **Start Small**: Test on small datasets first
2. **Monitor Costs**: Check BigQuery billing for ML function costs
3. **Set Budgets**: Use GCP budget alerts for BigQuery spending
4. **Review Queries**: Check generated SQL before running on large datasets

---

## 🐛 Troubleshooting

### "ML.FORECAST not found"

**Cause**: BigQuery ML is not enabled in your project
**Fix**: Run `bq query "SELECT 1"` to enable BigQuery API

### "Insufficient data for forecasting"

**Cause**: Less than 30 days of historical data
**Fix**: Load more historical cost data or use SQL-based anomaly detection

### "ask_data_insights quota exceeded"

**Cause**: Free tier limits on Gemini API calls
**Fix**:
1. Wait 60 seconds for quota reset
2. Switch to `gemini-1.5-flash` (higher quota)
3. Upgrade to paid tier

### "Permission denied on ML.FORECAST"

**Cause**: Service account missing BigQuery permissions
**Fix**: Grant `roles/bigquery.jobUser` to your service account

   ```
   Expected: Agent calls `forecast()` tool, returns predictions with confidence intervals

2. **Insights Test**:
   ```
   "What insights can you provide about cost patterns?"
   ```
   Expected: Agent calls `ask_data_insights()` tool, returns AI-generated insights

3. **SQL Anomaly Test**:
   ```
   "Find applications where costs spiked above $10,000 in February"
   ```
   Expected: Agent uses SQL with window functions, returns threshold-based anomalies

**Monitor Logs For**:
```
[sql_generation] Classified intent: ANOMALY_DETECTION
[sql_generation] Using tool: forecast
[sql_generation] Using tool: ask_data_insights
```

If you see these log messages, ML integration is working correctly!
