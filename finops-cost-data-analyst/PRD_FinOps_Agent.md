## üéØ Use Cases

### Use Case 1: Daily Cost Check
**Actor**: FinOps Manager

**Query**: "What was our cloud spending yesterday?"

**Flow**:
1. User asks question in natural language
2. Agent classifies as COST query
3. Discovers cost_dataset.cost_analysis table
4. Gets schema dynamically
5. Generates SQL with date filter
6. Executes and returns formatted result

**Expected Response**:
```
Yesterday's cloud spending was $45,234.56.

Breakdown by cloud provider:
- AWS: $28,500.00 (63%)
- GCP: $12,000.00 (27%)
- Azure: $4,734.56 (10%)
```

### Use Case 2: Budget Variance Analysis
**Actor**: CFO
**Frequency**: Monthly
**Query**: "Are we over budget for FY26?"

**Flow**:
1. Agent classifies as COMPARISON query
2. Discovers both cost_dataset and budget_dataset
3. Gets schemas for both tables
4. Generates JOIN query
5. Calculates variance
6. Returns analysis

**Expected Response**:
```
FY26 Budget Status (as of Oct 21, 2025):

Actual Spending: $27,442,275.64
